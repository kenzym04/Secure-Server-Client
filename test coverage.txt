1. Configuration Variations
reread_on_query Parameter:
Tests the behavior of search_query with reread_on_query set to both True and False.
Ensures that performance metrics are collected for different configurations:
reread_on_query=True: Reinitializes the file or memory-mapped data structure on each query.

2. File Size Performance
File Sizes Tested:
10,000 rows
50,000 rows
100,000 rows
250,000 rows
Metrics Collected:

Key Metrics:
QPS: Queries executed per second.
Assertions:
Ensures the server can handle more than 1 query per second.

QPS is calculated based on the number of queries completed within 1 second.
Conclusion
The test_performance.py script provides comprehensive coverage for performance testing, including execution time analysis and QPS evaluation. It validates server behavior under varying configurations and file sizes.

test_file_sizes_rows_vs_qps.py
The test_file_sizes_rows_vs_qps.py script performs a comprehensive performance evaluation of a server's ability to handle queries per second (QPS) under different conditions. Here is a summary of the test coverage:

Key Functionalities Tested:
Server Setup and Teardown:

The setUpClass method starts the server in a separate thread before all tests.
The tearDownClass method stops the server and joins the thread after all tests are complete.
SSL Context and Client Socket Creation:

The script creates an SSL context for secure connections when needed.
It also creates client sockets to send queries to the server.
Query Sending and Response Handling:

The send_query method sends a query to the server and returns the response, handling both SSL and non-SSL connections.
Test Data Generation:

The generate_test_file method creates test files with a specified number of random lines to simulate different workloads.
Performance Testing:

test_queries_per_second:
This test measures the server's QPS for a fixed file size (250,000 lines) by sending increasing numbers of queries until the server cannot handle additional load efficiently (when total query execution exceeds 1 second).
test_file_sizes_vs_qps:
This test evaluates the server's QPS for various file sizes (ranging from 10,000 to 1,000,000,000 lines).
It sends increasing numbers of queries (up to 1,000 for faster testing) and measures the QPS.
It stops sending queries if the server takes more than 1 second to respond.
The maximum QPS achieved for each file size is logged and compared.
Assertions ensure that QPS is greater than 0 for each file size and that QPS generally decreases as file size increases.
Summary and Assertions:

The script prints a summary of the maximum QPS achieved for each file size.
It includes assertions to verify that larger file sizes generally result in lower QPS, validating the server's performance degradation with increased workload.
Conclusion:
The test_file_sizes_rows_vs_qps.py script provides a detailed analysis of the server's performance by measuring QPS against varying file sizes and query loads. It effectively tests the server's ability to handle different workloads, logging the maximum QPS achieved, and identifying performance limitations.

test_file_sizes_bytes_vs_qps_mocked.py
The test_file_sizes_bytes_vs_qps_mocked.py script provides a performance evaluation of a server using mocked functions to simulate the impact of file sizes on queries per second (QPS). Here's a summary of the test coverage:

Key Functionalities Tested:
Mocked Time and Query Sending:

time.time is mocked to simulate consistent and predictable timing for the queries.
client.send_search_query is mocked to return a predefined response ("MOCKED_RESPONSE"), avoiding the need for actual server interaction.
Performance Testing with Simulated File Sizes:

File Sizes: The test simulates file sizes of 1,000 to 1,000,000 bytes.
Max Queries: The number of queries tested is reduced to 1,000 for efficiency.
Simulated Impact of File Size:
The test includes a naive simulation where the response time increases with larger file sizes (time.sleep(file_size / 1000000000)), emulating real-world scenarios where larger files might take longer to process.
QPS Measurement:

The script calculates QPS by measuring the time taken to process increasing numbers of queries (up to 1,000).
It logs progress every 100 queries and stops when the total time for processing queries exceeds 1 second, indicating the server's limit.
Results and Assertions:

QPS Results: Maximum QPS for each file size is logged and compared.
Assertions:
Ensures QPS is finite and greater than 0 for each file size.
Verifies that QPS generally decreases as file size increases, reflecting the expected performance degradation with larger files.
Output:

The test provides a summary of maximum QPS achieved for each file size, demonstrating the server's handling capacity and limitations under different simulated file sizes.
Conclusion:
The test_file_sizes_bytes_vs_qps_mocked.py script effectively simulates server performance under varying file sizes using mocking. It provides insights into how the server might behave with different workloads, focusing on QPS and the impact of increasing file sizes on server performance. This approach allows testing server behavior without needing an actual server or large files, ensuring efficient and focused testing.
