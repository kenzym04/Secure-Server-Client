The script creates an SSL context for secure connections when needed.
It also creates client sockets to send queries to the server.
Query Sending and Response Handling:

The send_query method sends a query to the server and returns the response, handling both SSL and non-SSL connections.
Test Data Generation:

The generate_test_file method creates test files with a specified number of random lines to simulate different workloads.
Performance Testing:

test_queries_per_second:
This test measures the server's QPS for a fixed file size (250,000 lines) by sending increasing numbers of queries until the server cannot handle additional load efficiently (when total query execution exceeds 1 second).
test_file_sizes_vs_qps:
This test evaluates the server's QPS for various file sizes (ranging from 10,000 to 1,000,000,000 lines).
It sends increasing numbers of queries (up to 1,000 for faster testing) and measures the QPS.
It stops sending queries if the server takes more than 1 second to respond.
The maximum QPS achieved for each file size is logged and compared.
Assertions ensure that QPS is greater than 0 for each file size and that QPS generally decreases as file size increases.
Summary and Assertions:

The script prints a summary of the maximum QPS achieved for each file size.

time.time is mocked to simulate consistent and predictable timing for the queries.
client.send_search_query is mocked to return a predefined response ("MOCKED_RESPONSE"), avoiding the need for actual server interaction.
Performance Testing with Simulated File Sizes:

File Sizes: The test simulates file sizes of 1,000 to 1,000,000 bytes.
Max Queries: The number of queries tested is reduced to 1,000 for efficiency.
Simulated Impact of File Size:
The test includes a naive simulation where the response time increases with larger file sizes (time.sleep(file_size / 1000000000)), emulating real-world scenarios where larger files might take longer to process.
QPS Measurement:

The script calculates QPS by measuring the time taken to process increasing numbers of queries (up to 1,000).
It logs progress every 100 queries and stops when the total time for processing queries exceeds 1 second, indicating the server's limit.
Results and Assertions:

QPS Results: Maximum QPS for each file size is logged and compared.
Assertions:
Ensures QPS is finite and greater than 0 for each file size.
Verifies that QPS generally decreases as file size increases, reflecting the expected performance degradation with larger files.
Output:

The test provides a summary of maximum QPS achieved for each file size, demonstrating the server's handling capacity and limitations under different simulated file sizes.
Conclusion:
The test_file_sizes_bytes_vs_qps_mocked.py script effectively simulates server performance under varying file sizes using mocking. It provides insights into how the server might behave with different workloads, focusing on QPS and the impact of increasing file sizes on server performance. This approach allows testing server behavior without needing an actual server or large files, ensuring efficient and focused testing.
