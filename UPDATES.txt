- Your implementation does not ensure full matches only for string searches, leading to potential false positives.
Already implemented in previous version: Done
The search_query function currently checks for an exact match by comparing the query string against the lines in file_lines (when rereading the file) or the file_set (cached set of lines). It uses a simple containment check (query in file_lines or query in file_set), which is indeed performing exact matches against the lines in the file or set.

- The performance requirements for execution times are not explicitly validated in the code provided.
Already implemented in previous version: Done
Performance Checks:
Execution Time Logging:

The test_performance function measures and logs the average execution time for different file sizes and the number of queries per second (QPS).
The results are printed and logged, confirming whether the execution times meet the expected thresholds based on reread_on_query settings.
Assertions explicitly check that average execution times for 250,000 rows stay within set limits (40 ms with REREAD_ON_QUERY=True and 0.5 ms with REREAD_ON_QUERY=False).
Query Performance:

The test_large_query_performance, test_search_query_performance, and test_query_time_measurement functions measure the time taken for individual or large queries.
These functions assert that the queries complete within a specified time frame (e.g., 5 seconds for a 1MB query).
Edge Case Checks:
File Reloading:

The test_file_reloading function checks how the server handles dynamic updates to the file and whether the changes are reflected in query responses.
Payload Size Limit:

The test_payload_size_limit function tests responses to queries of varying sizes, ensuring the server correctly handles payloads up to the defined limit.
Query Injection Attempt:

The test_query_injection_attempt function validates that the server responds safely to potentially malicious SQL injection-like queries.
Unicode and Special Characters:

The test_query_with_unicode_characters and test_edge_cases functions validate handling of non-ASCII characters and special character queries.
Very Long Queries:

The test_edge_cases function also handles exceptionally long queries, ensuring the server can process or appropriately respond to these without failure.
Concurrent Queries:

The test_concurrent_queries function ensures the server can handle multiple concurrent requests efficiently.
SSL Connection:

The test_ssl_connection function verifies SSL connectivity and proper handling of secure queries.
Conclusion:
The provided code explicitly validates performance requirements and handles a wide range of edge cases through structured tests, logging, and assertions. It ensures that execution times and query handling meet the defined performance criteria, with additional checks for security and data integrity.



- There are hardcoded paths in your configuration, which prevent the test suite from running flawlessly in a stand-alone fashion.
1. Server.py
Based on the provided code snippet, there are no hardcoded paths in the server implementation. The code uses environment variables and default values to set up the directory and file paths dynamically. Here's a breakdown of how the paths are handled:
The use of environment variables (os.getenv) with fallback defaults ensures that paths are configurable and adaptable to different environments. Specifically:

Dynamic Path Configuration:

All key paths (FILE_RELATIVE_PATH, PID_FILE, CONFIG_PATH, LOG_FILE, etc.) use environment variables for flexibility, with reasonable default values as fallbacks.
SSL Certificate and Key:

SSL paths (cert_file and key_file) are configurable using SSL_CERT_FILE and SSL_KEY_FILE environment variables.
Logging:

The log file path (LOG_FILE) is configurable via the LOG_DIR environment variable.
File and Data Directories:

File-related paths (FILE_RELATIVE_PATH and others) now rely on DATA_DIR, ensuring they can be changed without modifying the code.

2. Client.py
Revised
The current client.py does not have hardcoded paths. Instead, it uses a combination of environment variables and dynamic path construction to determine the locations of configuration and log files. Here's a breakdown of how the paths are handled:
1.
The script directory is determined dynamically:
SCRIPT_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
2.
The base directory is set as the parent of the script directory:
BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(SCRIPT_DIR)
3.
The configuration directory is set relative to the base directory:
DEFAULT_CONFIG_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "config")
4.
The configuration file path can be set via an environment variable, or it defaults to a path within the config directory:
CONFIG_PATH = os.getenv('CONFIG_PATH', os.path.join(DEFAULT_CONFIG_DIR, "config.ini"))
5.
Similarly, the log directory is set relative to the base directory:
DEFAULT_LOG_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "logs")
6.
The log file path can be set via an environment variable, or it defaults to a path within the log directory:
LOG_FILE = os.getenv('LOG_FILE', os.path.join(DEFAULT_LOG_DIR, "client.log"))
7.
The script ensures that the necessary directories exist:
os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(CONFIG_PATH), exist_ok=True)
os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(LOG_FILE), exist_ok=True)

All these paths are configurable through environment variables, making the implementation flexible and avoiding hardcoded paths.

3. Server_daemon.py
The paths are constructed dynamically using the os.path module and relative paths. Here's a breakdown of how the paths are handled:
1.
The script directory is determined dynamically:
SCRIPT_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
2.
The base directory is set as the parent of the script directory:
BASE_DIR = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(SCRIPT_DIR, ".."))
3.
The PID file path is constructed using the base directory:
PID_FILE = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "server_daemon.pid")
4.
The log file path is constructed using the base directory:
LOG_FILE = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "logs", "server_daemon.log")
5.
The project root is added to the Python path dynamically:
project_root = os.path.abspath(
    os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__),
                 '..')
)
sys.path.insert(0, project_root)
